      <h2>6 Tips to Landing the Perfect Job for you</h2>
	  <p><b>1. Networking</b></p> 
      <p>Networking with almost anyone new you meet is a highly suggested tip to "get yourself out there". Who knows, maybe the person you talked to on the train this morning can help you land that job you have been wanting for the longest. It is as easy as that.</p>
	  <p><b>2. Have confidence in your abilities</b></p> 
      <p>You may come across a job that requires good skills in something you've had some experience in but you don't feel confident. Or you may have never done the specific task it is they want you to do, but if you feel you may be interested in it and have at least some skill you should definitely go for it!</p>
	  <p><b>3. Know what it is you are interested in</b></p>
      <p>Find your passions and follow them. You want a career that you will enjoy doing for however long it is you plan on doing it. The more you enjoy your job, the better of a fit it is for you, so do not settle. 
      <p><b>4. Do your research</p></b>
	  <p>Make sure you know exactly what you are getting yourself into. The place you want to work for may offer an astounding salary, but their mission or work environment may not be what you are comfortable with.</p>
	  <p><b>5. Stay organized</b></p>
	  <p>Finding a job, especially the perfect one, can be stressful. Keep note of places you applied to and want to apply to. Keep a journal with some goals and things you can talk about in interviews to make even more of an impression.</p>
	  <p><b>6. Get some experience</b></p>
	  <p>If possible try volunteering or landing an internship wherever it is you want to work. This will get you ahead of any other applicants because you will learn what it is the company is expecting of you. This is also a very good oppurtunity to network and make a name for yourself.</p>
